# AmortizedOptimalTransport
Get two images A and B and map the color palette of image B onto image A. Implemented iteratively with the sinkhorn algorithm. The goal of this project is to create my own implementation of the sinkhorn algorithm and then approximate a warm start to the algorithm by training a neural network.
